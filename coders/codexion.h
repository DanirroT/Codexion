/*
number_of_coders: The number of coders and also the number of dongles.

time_to_burnout (in milliseconds): If a coder did not start compiling within
time_to_burnout milliseconds since the beginning of their last compile or the
beginning of the simulation, they burn out.

time_to_compile (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a coder to compile.
During that time, they must hold two dongles.

time_to_debug (in milliseconds): The time a coder will spend debugging.

time_to_refactor (in milliseconds): The time a coder will spend refactoring.
After completing the refactoring phase, the coder will immediately attempt to
acquire dongles and start compiling again.
number_of_compiles_required: If all coders have compiled at least this
many times, the simulation stops. Otherwise, it stops when a coder burns
out.

dongle_cooldown (in milliseconds): After being released, a dongle is unavailable until its cooldown has passed.

scheduler: The arbitration policy used by dongles to decide who gets them
when multiple coders request them.
The value must be exactly one of: fifo or edf.
- fifo means First In, First Out: the dongle is granted to the coder whose
request arrived first.
- edf means Earliest Deadline First with deadline = last_compile_start +
time_to_burnout.
